                    <ul>
                        <li>A website using Streamlit API for front-end, and Python, Tensorflow, and Scikitt-Learn as the backend framework. It uses Tensorflow to build two models: Long Short-Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Network to compare the performance between them at predicting the stock trend of a company chosen by the user. </li>
                        <li>What I like about this project:</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A cool user interface.</li>
                            <li>The user can search and select any company that they like.</li>
                            <li>The models will be trained on the data of the selected company, so the prediction will be more precise as the dataset is not general.</li>
                            <li>The user can modify some features to customize the models.</li>
                        </ol>
